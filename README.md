# SPS
This website was created by Sandra Barbosa, Paris Jija and Sarita Radia for our Code First Girls Introduction to Web Development Project.

The project consists of two pages, the Portfolio and the Contact Page. We have implemented HTML, CSS and JavaScipt. 

Both pages have the same navigation bar and footer. 

**Navigation bar**
The navigation bar consists of the SPS logo (which expands upon hovering), and the Portfolio, Contact and Instagram links. 

On smaller screens, the navigation bar transforms to a hamburger dropdown menu.

**Footer**
The footer contains copyright information, an email subscription text box and two social icons.

**Portfolio**
The Portfolio contains a photo carousel (BootStrap) at the top. Under the carousel, we have created a 3 x 4 photo grid. 

Upon hovering the individual images in the grid, the image is enlarged with a box shadow. 

**Contact page**
The contact page allows users to send a message directly from the page, along with the contact information nested at the top righthand side. 

**Submit form**
Upon completing the form on the Contact page, we have used an additional HTML page to thank the user for their message 

**Images**
The images were sourced from Unsplash (https://unsplash.com/), with the exception of the Mezio Swing which was created by Sandra Barbosa.
